# FreshCode (BlogChallenge)

### Description
This is the result of a challenge to build a blog website exercising the following practices:
- BootStrap Styling
- Custom styling
- Node.js/Express.js for serving data
- EJS for HTML templating
- GET/POST Requests for creating/retrieving data
- JavaScript scripting for user interaction


### Setting Up Environment
- To view project, you'll need to first install the node modules used. Once cloned, use `npm install` to install the dependencies already listed in `/package.json`.
- Once installed, run `node app.js` from the terminal to start the server.
- The site should be live at localhost:3000, as this was what I had used for development.


### Closing Remarks / Feedback
This is an early project/exercise that I have completed on my own. It's simple but definitely allowed me to delve into what builds a webpage and how to make the build less redundant.
